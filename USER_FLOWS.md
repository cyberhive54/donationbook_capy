Every festival page applies:
- Background color OR background image
- Primary color (buttons, accents)
- Secondary color (secondary UI)
- Text color
- Border color

## 🔐 Security Notes

### Current Implementation:
```
- Client-side password protection

- Public RLS policies (anyone can read/write)
- No rate limiting
- No HTTPS enforcement (depends on hosting)

Suitable for:
- Small communities (hostels, clubs)
- Trusted user groups
- Non-sensitive financial data
```

### Production Recommendations:
```
- Implement Supabase Auth
- Hash passwords (bcrypt/argon2)
- Server-side API routes
- Row Level Security with user authentication
- Rate limiting on uploads
- HTTPS only
- Environment variable encryption
```
