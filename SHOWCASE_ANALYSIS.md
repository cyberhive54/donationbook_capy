# Showcase Feature - Complete Analysis

## Overview
The Showcase feature allows admins to create albums and upload media (photos, videos, audio, PDFs) that users can view. This is a gallery/media management system integrated into the festival pages.

---

## ✅ What's Implemented

### 1. **Database Schema** ✅
**File**: `supabase-migration-showcase.sql`

**Tables Created:**
- **`albums`** - Stores album information
  - `id` (UUID, primary key)
  - `festival_id` (UUID, foreign key to festivals)
  - `title` (text, required)
  - `description` (text, optional)
  - `year` (int, optional)
  - `cover_url` (text, optional) - Not currently used
  - `created_at` (timestamp)
  - Indexes: `festival_id`, `year`
  - Cascade delete when festival is deleted

- **`media_items`** - Stores media files metadata
  - `id` (UUID, primary key)
  - `album_id` (UUID, foreign key to albums)
  - `type` (enum: 'image', 'video', 'audio', 'pdf', 'other')
  - `title` (text, optional)
  - `description` (text, optional)
  - `url` (text, required) - Supabase Storage public URL
  - `mime_type` (text, optional)
  - `size_bytes` (bigint, optional)
  - `duration_sec` (int, optional) - For audio/video
  - `thumbnail_url` (text, optional) - Not currently used
  - `created_at` (timestamp)
  - Indexes: `album_id`, `type`
  - Cascade delete when album is deleted

**RLS Policies:** ✅
- Public SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE on both tables
- Allows anonymous access (consistent with other app tables)

---

### 2. **TypeScript Types** ✅
**File**: `types/index.ts`

```typescript
export interface Album {
  id: string;
  festival_id: string;
  title: string;
  description?: string;
  year?: number;
  cover_url?: string;
  created_at?: string;
}

export type MediaType = 'image' | 'video' | 'audio' | 'pdf' | 'other';

export interface MediaItem {
  id: string;
  album_id: string;
  type: MediaType;
  title?: string;
  description?: string;
  url: string;
  mime_type?: string;
  size_bytes?: number;
  duration_sec?: number;
  created_at?: string;
  thumbnail_url?: string;
}
```

All types properly defined and used throughout the codebase.

## ⚠️ Issues & Requirements

### 1. **Storage Bucket Must Be Created Manually** 🔴
**Status**: REQUIRED MANUAL SETUP

**What's Needed:**
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → Storage
2. Create a new bucket named **`showcase`**
3. Make it **public** (allow public access)
4. Configure CORS if needed

**Why:**
The app uploads files to `supabase.storage.from('showcase')` but this bucket doesn't exist by default. Without it, uploads will fail with error.

**SQL Migration Note Says:**
```sql
-- Note: Create a public storage bucket named 'showcase' in Supabase Storage and make it public.
-- App will upload files to storage and persist public URLs in media_items.url.
```

This is a **manual step** that cannot be automated via SQL migration.

---

### 2. **Storage Files Not Deleted** ⚠️
**Status**: MINOR ISSUE

**Problem:**
When a media item is deleted from the database, the file remains in Supabase Storage. Over time, this will accumulate orphaned files.

**Current Code:**
```typescript
const handleDelete = async (id: string) => {
  const { error } = await supabase.from('media_items').delete().eq('id', id);
  // ❌ Does not delete from storage
};
```

**Impact:**
- Storage usage grows over time
- Old files remain accessible via URL
- Storage costs increase

**Recommended Fix:**
Before deleting from database, extract the storage path from the URL and delete the file:
```typescript
const handleDelete = async (item: MediaItem) => {
  // Extract path from URL
  const url = new URL(item.url);
  const path = url.pathname.split('/storage/v1/object/public/showcase/')[1];
  
  // Delete from storage
  await supabase.storage.from('showcase').remove([path]);
  
  // Then delete from database
  await supabase.from('media_items').delete().eq('id', item.id);
};
```

### 3. **Album Cover Image Not Implemented** 📝
**Status**: FEATURE NOT USED

**Database Field Exists:**
- `albums.cover_url` exists in schema
- Not used anywhere in the UI

**Potential Enhancement:**
- Allow setting a cover image for each album
- Display cover in album grid (admin and showcase)
- Auto-set first uploaded image as cover
- Option to change cover

---

### 4. **Media Thumbnails Not Generated** 📝
**Status**: FEATURE NOT USED

**Database Field Exists:**
- `media_items.thumbnail_url` exists in schema
- Not used anywhere in the UI

**Current Behavior:**
- Images load full-size in grid (could be slow)
- Videos show type label (no video thumbnail)
- PDFs show type label (no preview)

**Potential Enhancement:**
- Generate thumbnails on upload
- Use Supabase Image Transformation API
- Store thumbnail URLs
- Display thumbnails in grids for faster loading

---

### 5. **No Video/Audio Playback UI** 📝
**Status**: LIMITED FUNCTIONALITY

**Current Behavior:**
- All media items are links that open in new tab
- Videos open in browser video player
- Audio opens in browser audio player

**Potential Enhancement:**
- Inline video player in showcase page
- Inline audio player
- Lightbox for images
- PDF viewer embed

---

### 6. **No File Size Limits** ⚠️
**Status**: POTENTIAL ISSUE

**Current Behavior:**
- No client-side file size validation
- Supabase has default limits (50MB for free tier)
- Large uploads may fail silently

**Recommended:**
- Add file size check before upload (e.g., max 10MB)
- Show error if file too large
- Display file size in media list

---

### 7. **No Upload Progress Indicator** 📝
**Status**: UX IMPROVEMENT NEEDED

**Current Behavior:**
- Upload button disabled during upload
- No progress bar or percentage shown
- Users don't know if large files are still uploading

**Recommended:**
- Add progress bar using Supabase upload progress callback
- Show upload percentage
- Allow canceling upload

---

### 8. **Media Description Field Not Used** 📝
**Status**: FIELD EXISTS BUT UNUSED

**Database Field:**
- `media_items.description` exists
- Never set or displayed

**Potential Enhancement:**
- Add description input in upload/edit flow
- Display descriptions on hover or in detail view

---

### 9. **No Media Editing** 📝
**Status**: MISSING FEATURE

**Current Behavior:**
- Can only delete media items
- Cannot edit title, description, or type

**Potential Enhancement:**
- Edit media item modal
- Update title, description
- Cannot change type or URL (immutable)

---

### 10. **Cascade Delete Works** ✅
**Status**: WORKING CORRECTLY

When a festival is deleted:
1. All albums for that festival are deleted (cascade)
2. All media items in those albums are deleted (cascade)
3. ⚠️ But storage files remain (see Issue #2)

When an album is deleted:
1. All media items in that album are deleted (cascade)
2. ⚠️ But storage files remain (see Issue #2)

## 🚀 Recommended Enhancements

### Priority 1 (Important):
1. **Fix storage file deletion** - Delete files when media items deleted
2. **Add file size validation** - Prevent uploads > 10MB
3. **Add upload progress indicator** - Show upload percentage

### Priority 2 (Nice to Have):
4. **Generate thumbnails** - For faster loading
5. **Implement album cover images** - Visual appeal
6. **Add inline media viewer** - Lightbox for images, player for videos
7. **Allow media editing** - Change title/description

### Priority 3 (Future):
8. **Bulk operations** - Delete multiple media items at once
9. **Sorting options** - Sort media by date, name, type
10. **Search functionality** - Search media by title
11. **Media analytics** - View counts, popular media
12. **Share URLs** - Direct links to specific albums/media

---

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Current Setup:
- ✅ RLS policies allow public CRUD (consistent with app design)
- ✅ Per-festival isolation works (albums filtered by `festival_id`)
- ✅ Storage bucket is public (users can view media)
- ⚠️ Anyone with URL can access storage files
- ⚠️ No upload rate limiting
- ⚠️ No file type restrictions (security risk)

### Recommendations:
1. **Add file type validation** - Only allow safe types
2. **Add rate limiting** - Prevent upload abuse
3. **Scan uploads for malware** - Use Supabase Functions
4. **Add CORS restrictions** - Limit storage access to your domain
5. **Consider signed URLs** - For private albums (future feature)

---

## 📊 Storage Usage Estimate

**Example:**
- 10 festivals
- 5 albums per festival = 50 albums
- 20 photos per album = 1000 photos
- Average 2MB per photo = **2GB total**

**Supabase Free Tier:**
- 1GB storage included
- Would need paid tier for above scenario

**Recommendation:**
- Monitor storage usage in Supabase Dashboard
- Implement file size limits
- Consider image compression before upload
- Clean up orphaned files regularly

---

## 📝 Code Quality

### Strengths:
✅ Clean component structure  
✅ Proper TypeScript typing  
✅ Good separation of concerns
