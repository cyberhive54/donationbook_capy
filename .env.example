#

# ============================================
# TROUBLESHOOTING
# ============================================
#
# "Supabase credentials not found":
# - Check this file is named '.env.local' (not .env.local.txt)
# - Verify values have no extra spaces
# - Restart development server: npm run dev
#
# "Failed to fetch data":
# - Verify Supabase project is active
# - Check all migrations were run successfully
# - Confirm API credentials are correct
# - Check browser console for specific errors
#
# "Storage upload failed":
# - Verify 'showcase' bucket exists in Supabase Storage
# - Check bucket is set to PUBLIC
# - Run 'supabase-storage-fix.sql' for permissions
# - Verify file size is within limits (15MB/50MB)
#
# "Password not working":
# - Each festival has its own passwords
# - Check you're using the correct festival code
# - Passwords are case-sensitive
# - Admin password can be changed in admin panel
# - Sessions expire daily - re-enter password next day
#
# "Storage limit exceeded":
# - Each festival has 400MB total storage
# - Check storage usage in admin panel (click storage bar)
# - Delete unused media to free up space
# - Consider creating a new festival for new events
#

# ============================================
# PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT
# ============================================
#
# When deploying to Vercel, Netlify, Railway, etc.:
#
# 1. Add environment variables in platform dashboard:
#    - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
#    - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
#
# 2. Ensure all SQL migrations are run in production Supabase
#
# 3. Create 'showcase' storage bucket in production
#
# 4. DO NOT commit .env.local to repository
#
# 5. Set up custom domain (optional)
#
# 6. Configure CORS in Supabase if needed
#

# ============================================
# SECURITY NOTES
# ============================================
#
# Current Implementation (Community/Small Group Use):
# - Client-side password protection
# - Public Supabase RLS policies
# - Passwords stored in plain text in database
# - NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix makes variables accessible in browser
#
# This is suitable for:
# - Small communities (hostels, clubs)
# - Trusted user groups
# - Non-sensitive financial data
# - Festival/event tracking
#
# For Production/Enterprise Use, Consider:
# - Implement Supabase Auth (email/password, OAuth)
# - Hash passwords (bcrypt, argon2)
# - Server-side API routes for sensitive operations
# - Row Level Security (RLS) with user authentication
# - Rate limiting on uploads
# - HTTPS only
# - Environment variable encryption
# - Audit logging
# - Regular security audits
#
# The NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY is safe to expose:
# - It's designed to be public (client-side use)
# - RLS policies control data access
# - Never expose SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY in client code
#

# ============================================
