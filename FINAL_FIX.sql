-- 1. DISABLE RLS on storage.objects (this is the key!)
ALTER TABLE storage.objects DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- 2. DISABLE RLS on albums and media_items tables
ALTER TABLE albums DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE media_items DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- 3. Make sure bucket is public
UPDATE storage.buckets SET public = true WHERE id = 'showcase';

-- 4. Grant ALL permissions
GRANT ALL ON storage.objects TO anon, authenticated, public;
GRANT ALL ON storage.buckets TO anon, authenticated, public;
GRANT ALL ON TABLE albums TO anon, authenticated, public;
GRANT ALL ON TABLE media_items TO anon, authenticated, public;

-- 5. Verify setup
SELECT 'BUCKET CHECK' as info, id, name, public FROM storage.buckets WHERE id = 'showcase';
